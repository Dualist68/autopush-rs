//! I/O wrapper created through `Dispatch`
//!
//! Most I/O happens through just raw TCP sockets, but at the beginning of a
//! request we'll take a look at the headers and figure out where to route it.
//! After that, for tungstenite the websocket library, we'll want to replay the
//! data we already read as there's no ability to pass this in currently. That
//! means we'll parse headers twice, but alas!
